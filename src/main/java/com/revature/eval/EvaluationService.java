	 * 5. Implement a binary search algorithm.
	 * 
	 * Searching a sorted collection is a common task. A dictionary is a sorted list
	 * of word definitions. Given a word, one can find its definition. A telephone
	 * book is a sorted list of people's names, addresses, and telephone numbers.
	 * Knowing someone's name allows one to quickly find their telephone number and
	 * address.
	 * 
	 * If the list to be searched contains more than a few items (a dozen, say) a
	 * binary search will require far fewer comparisons than a linear search, but it
	 * imposes the requirement that the list be sorted.
	 * 
	 * In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds
	 * the position of a specified input value (the search "key") within an array
	 * sorted by key value.
	 * 
	 * In each step, the algorithm compares the search key value with the key value
	 * of the middle element of the array.
	 * 
	 * If the keys match, then a matching element has been found and its index, or
	 * position, is returned.
	 * 
	 * Otherwise, if the search key is less than the middle element's key, then the
	 * algorithm repeats its action on the sub-array to the left of the middle
	 * element or, if the search key is greater, on the sub-array to the right.
	 * 
	 * If the remaining array to be searched is empty, then the key cannot be found
	 * in the array and a special "not found" indication is returned.
	 * 
	 * A binary search halves the number of items to check with each iteration, so
	 * locating an item (or determining its absence) takes logarithmic time. A
	 * binary search is a dichotomic divide and conquer search algorithm.
